Social Media App Screens

This repository contains a Flutter project that showcases the design and implementation of multiple user interface screens for a modern social media application. The goal of this project is to provide a practical foundation for developers, students, or hobbyists who want to understand how to build reusable, responsive, and visually appealing screens in Flutter, following Material Design principles.

The app is structured into feature-based folders for better scalability and maintainability. Each screen demonstrates different aspects of a social media app, ranging from user interaction with posts to exploring trending content. Below is an overview of the key screens included:

Home Feed Screen: Displays a timeline of posts with support for likes, comments, and sharing. It demonstrates how to build scrollable lists, reusable widgets, and interactive post components.
Trending Screen: Shows popular posts and content gaining traction. This screen focuses on layout organization, grid/list presentation, and engagement-driven UI design.
Reels Screen: Implements a vertical short-video layout similar to Instagram Reels or TikTok. It highlights gesture handling, full-screen media display, and smooth scrolling.
Notifications Screen: Displays alerts for user activity, including likes, comments, and follows. It provides a clean and organized way to represent chronological events.
User Profile Screen: Shows user details, profile picture, and activity. This screen demonstrates profile design and navigation integration.
Most Liked Screen: Highlights posts with the highest engagement, focusing on ranking and data visualization.
